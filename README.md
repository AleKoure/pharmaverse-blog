# Purpose of Blog Site

The communications working group is a small team within the (admiral)[https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/cran-release/] core team that seeks to promote and showcase admiral functions, documentation and possibilities.  ADaMs only form a small, but essential, part of the Clinical Reporting pipeline and so we also would like this site to highlight other upstream and downstream packages and processes.

As the communication is a small team, we hope that readers, users and maintainers of Clinical Reporting packages are able to write blog pots
