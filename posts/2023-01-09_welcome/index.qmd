<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
long_slug <- "2023-01-09_welcome"
# renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

## Purpose

The communications working group (CWG) seeks to promote and showcase how R can be used in the Clinical Reporting pipeline through short and informative blog posts.  These posts will be hosted on this [site](TBL) and promoted on the pharmaverse slack channels as well as on LinkedIn.

As the CWG is a small team, we hope to make the blog development process easy enough that pharmaverse community members will be able to easily write blog posts with guidance from the CWG team.

## Spirit of a Blog Post

The CWG believes that the following 4 points will help guide the creation of Blog Posts. 

* **Short**
* **Personalized**
* **Self-Contained**
* **Readable**  

**Short:** Posts should aim to be under (X) read.  We encourage that longer posts be broken up into multiple posts.  Our main medium of promotion, LinkedIn,...

**Personalized:** Posts should have a personality! For example, a person wishing to post on a function in a package needs to differentiate the post from the documentation for function, i.e. we don't want to just recycle the documentation. How can you add your voice, experience?

**Self-Contained:**  Posts should work with minimal dependencies with data, packages and outside sources. Every dependency introduced in a post adds some risk to the post. As package dependencies change, posts should be built in a way that they can be updated to stay relevant.

**Readable:** The CWG sees this site as more of introductory site rather advanced user site. Therefore, the CWG feels that code should be introduced in a way that promotes readability over complexity. However, both can be done in the same post!


## What goes in a Blog

Depends on the type of post.  The CWG sees 3 types of Posts being made for the site.

1) Focus on packages in the Clinical Reporting Pipeline
2) Focus on functions from packages in the Clinical Reporting Pipeline
3) Focus on wider experiences of using R in the Clinical Reporting Pipeline

### Minimum Post Requirements

  * A unique image to help showcase the post.
  * 
  * Self-contained data.
  * Documentation of package versions


## How can I make a Blog Post

Step 1: Reach out to us through slack or make an issue

Step 2: Branch off `main`

Step 3: Review the Spirit of the Blog Post



<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "https://github.com/pharmaverse/comms_wg",
  name = long_slug
)
```
