<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
long_slug <- "2023-04-24_shiny_run_script"
# renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
# read data
list.files()
introR <- readxl::read_xlsx("Introduction to R for SAS Programmer Workshop.xlsx", skip = 2)
kickoff <- readxl::read_xlsx("{admiral} hackathon kick off.xlsx", skip = 2)
checkin <- readxl::read_xlsx("{admiral} hackathon check in.xlsx", skip = 2)
```

This January and February (2023), the `admiral` development team and the CDISC Open Source Alliance jointly hosted the admiral hackathon.
The idea was to build a community of `admiral` users, and help participants familiarize themselves with R and `admiral`. 

The hackathon was structured in two parts. 
First, we offered an introduction to R for SAS programmers, a three hour workshop for R beginners to get them up to speed. 
Here we covered practical R basics, talking about how the R-workflow differs from a SAS workflow, and discussed common R functions - mostly from the tidyverse. 
This ensured that hackathon participants were familiar with core R concepts. 
The [workshop recording](https://www.cdisc.org/events/webinar/pre-admiral-hackathon-workshop-introduction-r-sas-programmers) and the [course materials](https://pharmaverse.github.io/intro-to-r-for-sas-programmers-workshop/) are available online. 

The main hackathon consisted of several ADAM data generating tasks based on a specs file and synthetic data.
Participants were able to solve these tasks in groups at their own pace thanks to a online tool where participants could upload their task specific R scripts and they would get automatic feedback for the data-set produced by their script.
Script upload through [the feedback application](https://zxqguo-stefan0pascal-thoma.shinyapps.io/data_upload/) was available all through February, and we offered multiple online meetings throughout the month to discuss challenges and give some tips. 
If you are interested in learning more about the thoughts that went into the feedback application, you can read about it in [this blogpost](https://pharmaverse.github.io/comms_wg/posts/2023-03-14_hackathon_app/) or check out the [public GitHub repository for such an application](https://github.com/StefanThoma/hackathon_app).

```{r}
introR$`In which country do you reside in?:` %>% unique()
introR$`What kind of organization are you working for?:`
```
```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data = introR %>% 
         group_by(`What kind of organization are you working for?:`) %>% 
         summarise(n = n()), 
       mapping = aes(y = `What kind of organization are you working for?:`, fill = `What kind of organization are you working for?:`, x = n)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  ylab("") + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```


We were really excited to see over **500** people from around 40 countries joining our introduction to R workshop in January! 


## conclusion / future workshops



Should ask for feedback on hackathon


<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| eval: false
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "StefanThoma/quarto-blog",
  name = long_slug
)
```
