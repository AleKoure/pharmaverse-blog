```{r setup, include=FALSE}
long_slug <- "2023-04-24_shiny_run_script"
# renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

introR <- readxl::read_xlsx("Introduction to R for SAS Programmer Workshop.xlsx", skip = 2) %>% janitor::clean_names()

```

This January and February (2023), the `admiral` development team and the CDISC Open Source Alliance jointly hosted the admiral hackathon.
The idea was to build a community of `admiral` users, and help participants familiarize themselves with R and `admiral`. 

The hackathon was structured in two parts. 
First, we offered an introduction to R for SAS programmers, a three hour workshop for R beginners to get them up to speed. 
Here we covered practical R basics, talking about how the R-workflow differs from a SAS workflow, and discussed common R functions - mostly from the tidyverse. 
This ensured that hackathon participants were familiar with core R concepts. 
The [workshop recording](https://www.cdisc.org/events/webinar/pre-admiral-hackathon-workshop-introduction-r-sas-programmers) and the [course materials](https://pharmaverse.github.io/intro-to-r-for-sas-programmers-workshop/) are available online. 

The main hackathon consisted of several ADAM data generating tasks based on a specs file and synthetic data.
Participants were able to solve these tasks in groups at their own pace thanks to a online tool where participants could upload their task specific R scripts and they would get automatic feedback for the data-set produced by their script.
Script upload through [the feedback application](https://zxqguo-stefan0pascal-thoma.shinyapps.io/data_upload/) was available all through February, and we offered multiple online meetings throughout the month to discuss challenges and give some tips. 
If you are interested in learning more about the thoughts that went into the feedback application, you can read about it in [this blogpost](https://pharmaverse.github.io/comms_wg/posts/2023-03-14_hackathon_app/) or check out the [public GitHub repository for such an application](https://github.com/StefanThoma/hackathon_app).

## *Introduction to R* workshop

We were really excited to see over **500** people from around 40 countries joining our *introduction to R workshop* in January! 
To get to know prospective users and hackathon participants better, we conducted some polls during the meetings. 
Below you can see that representatives of many different sorts of organisations joined our introduction to R workshop: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data = introR %>% 
         group_by(what_kind_of_organization_are_you_working_for) %>% 
         summarise(n = n()), 
       mapping = aes(y = what_kind_of_organization_are_you_working_for, fill = what_kind_of_organization_are_you_working_for, x = n)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  ylab("") + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```
216 out of `r sum((introR$is_your_company_using_r_for_clinical_trial_data_analysis %>% table(useNA = "always"))[1:2])` confirmed that their company is already using R for clinial trial data analysis, the remaining 131 did not answer this question. 

The target audience for this workshop were programmers who are very familiar with SAS, but not so familiar with R, our polls confirmed this.
```{r}
#| echo: false
#introR$how_would_you_rate_your_sas_skills %>% factor(levels = c("Beginner",  "Intermediate","Advanced", "Expert")) %>% table() %>% plot(main = "SAS")
#introR$how_would_you_rate_your_r_skills %>% factor(levels = c("Beginner",  "Intermediate","Advanced", "Expert")) %>% table() %>% plot(main = "R")
  

# prepare plot data
introR %>% rename(
  R = how_would_you_rate_your_r_skills,
  SAS = how_would_you_rate_your_sas_skills) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(R, SAS), names_to = "lang", values_to = "skill") %>% 
  mutate(
  skill =    factor(skill, levels = c("Beginner",  "Intermediate","Advanced", "Expert"))
  ) %>%
  select(skill, lang) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  
  # plot it:
  ggplot(aes(y = skill, fill = lang)) +
  geom_bar() +  
  facet_grid(~lang) + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  

```

Overall, we were very happy with how the workshop turned out, and participants overall agreed with this sentiment (althogh there may be a slight [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)...).
```{r}
#| echo: false
temp_introR <- introR %>%
  mutate(how_would_you_rate_the_workshop = factor(how_would_you_rate_the_workshop, levels = c("Poor","Fair","Good","Excellent")), 
         the_workshop_was = factor(the_workshop_was, levels = c("too easy", "just right", "too difficult"))) %>% 
  select(how_would_you_rate_the_workshop, the_workshop_was) %>% 
  drop_na()

rate_plot <- temp_introR %>% 
ggplot(aes(x  =how_would_you_rate_the_workshop)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  xlab("") + 
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle("Quality")
  
difficulty_plot <- temp_introR %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x  = the_workshop_was)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  xlab("") + 
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle("Difficulty")


rate_plot + difficulty_plot
```

## `admiral` Hackathon 

We did similar polls at the `admiral` hackathon kick-off meeting where we still had 269 poll participants and even more viewers.

```{r}
kickoff$voter %>% max()
```
In the end, we had a total of 44 teams spanning 87 statistical programmers who took part in the admiral hackathon. 


A recording of the hackathon readout can be found in the [CDISC Open Source Alliance Quarterly Spotlight](https://www.cdisc.org/events/webinar/cosa-quarterly-spotlight-q1-2023).

Shout-out to our community hero: [Jagadish Katam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagadishkatam/) without whom most issues related to the task programming raised by the community would not have been adressed as quickly as they were. Huge thanks from the organisors!



## conclusion / future workshops



Should ask for feedback on hackathon


<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| eval: false
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "StefanThoma/quarto-blog",
  name = long_slug
