<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
long_slug <- "2023-03-14_shiny_run_script"
# renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

I recently co-created a shiny application for the `admiral` hackathon in February 2023.
The concept of the app seems quite promising for teaching data-manipulation in general, so I decided to publish the code on GitHub and write this short post for anyone interested.



<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "StefanThoma/quarto-blog",
  name = long_slug
)
```
